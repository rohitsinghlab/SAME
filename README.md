# SAME
Spatial Alignment of Multimodal Expression

![SAME Overview](figs/SAME_overview.jpg)

**SAME (Spatial Alignment of Multimodal Expression)** is a computational framework for aligning and integrating spatial omics data across serial tissue sections and modalities (e.g., proteins, transcripts, metabolites). SAME introduces space-tearing transforms, enabling controlled, localized topological disruptions during cross-sectional alignment. 

SAME implements the controlled space-tearing transforms using a 0-1 integer linear programming (ILP) model. The ILP model is implemented in the [Gurobi](https://www.gurobi.com/) solver. Please refer to the [Gurobi website](https://www.gurobi.com/) for a free academic license.
